# Ops-Pipeline

This was a exam project for the class MLOps.
Where we had to create a full machine learning pipeline which runs preprocessing, training and postprocessing script on Azure Cloud.
This got converted into a docker container and automatically pushed onto Github Container Registry using Github actions.
